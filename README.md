# 📦 IE-Tech Manufacturing Company Case Study: Production and Sales Optimization

## 📍 Overview
This project presents a **linear programming model** designed for IE-Tech Manufacturing Company to optimize the production and sales of robotic kits and components. IE-Tech operates plants in İstanbul, Ankara, and İzmir, specializing in pre-assembled robotic kits and premium robotics components. The goal is to maximize profitability while managing constraints such as labor, packing, assembly capacities, material limits, and market demand.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- **Optimized production and sales** of aluminum frames, carbon fiber frames, manual modules, advanced control modules, advanced sensor modules, and robotic kits.
- Considered **resource constraints** including labor, packing, and assembly capacities.
- Addressed **carbon fiber availability**, a critical material constraint.
- Analyzed **inventory management** and handling of **cost escalations** (12% increase in second-month costs).
- **Sensitivity analysis** performed on key constraints to identify potential profitability improvements.

## 📝 Model Summary
- **Objective**: Maximize total profit by balancing production, inventory holding costs, and sales revenues.
- **Decision Variables**: Quantities of components produced, kits assembled, sales, and inventories at each plant and period.
- **Constraints**:
  - Labor and packing time constraints for each plant and month.
  - Assembly capacity constraints for robotic kits.
  - Carbon fiber usage capped at 4000 units per month.
  - Minimum and maximum production demand constraints.
  - Inventory balance between periods.
- **Assumptions**: Linear relationships, divisibility, additivity, and certainty of parameters, with practical considerations of real-world constraints.

## 📊 Results
- **Total Profit**: $501,357.95 under current constraints.
- **Binding Constraints**: Labor, packing, assembly capacity, and carbon fiber availability.
- **Shadow Prices**: 
  - Labor: Up to $3.62 additional profit per extra unit.
  - Packing: Up to $4.44 additional profit per extra unit.
  - Assembly: Up to $2.35 additional profit per extra unit.
  - Carbon Fiber: Up to $1.53 additional profit per extra unit.

## 🔍 Recommendations
- Expand labor, packing, and assembly capacities in plants with high shadow prices.
- Increase carbon fiber availability to boost production capacity and profit.
- Adjust minimum and maximum demand constraints based on market conditions.
- Optimize inventory strategies, consider just-in-time production to minimize holding costs.
- Perform scenario analyses to evaluate the impact of resource adjustments.

## 📂 Files Included
- **Case Report**: Detailed explanation of the linear programming model, formulation, assumptions, sensitivity analysis, and recommendations.
- **Appendix**: Contains all tables of resource data, production costs, selling prices, and demand constraints.
